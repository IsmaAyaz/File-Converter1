What is AI? 
AI (Artificial Intelligence): Technology that enables machines to perform tasks that typically 
require human intelligence, like learning, problem-solving, and understanding natural language. 
Key Concepts and Uses: 
1. Deep Learning: A subset of AI that uses neural networks with many layers to learn and 
make decisions from large amounts of data. 
 Uses: Used in image and speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare 
diagnostics. 
2. CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): A type of deep learning network designed for 
processing and analyzing visual data, like images and videos. 
 Uses: Power applications such as facial recognition, object detection in images, and 
video analysis. 
3. NLP (Natural Language Processing): AI technology that allows machines to understand, 
interpret, and generate human language. 
 Uses: Used in chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis of text, and speech 
recognition systems. 
Static Websites: 
1. Fixed Content: The content doesn't change unless manually updated by someone. 
2. Faster Loading: Generally loads quickly because the content is pre-built. 
3. Simple: Easier to create and host. Great for small sites like personal blogs or company info 
pages. 
Dynamic Websites: 
 Changing Content: The content can change based on user interaction or other factors (like 
time, location, etc.). 
 Slower Loading: Might take slightly longer to load because the content is often generated 
on the fly. 
 Complex: More complex to create and manage. Used for larger sites like social media 
platforms, e-commerce sites, or web applications. 
DOM (Document Object Model): 
DOM is a representation of a web page in a structured format that allows programs and scripts to 
dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of the document. Think of it as a 
tree of objects representing the HTML elements of a web page. 
 
Virtual DOM: 
Virtual DOM is a concept used in modern web development frameworks like React. It is a 
lightweight copy of the actual DOM. Changes are first applied to the Virtual DOM, and then a 
comparison is made between the Virtual DOM and the actual DOM. Only the differences are 
updated in the actual DOM, making the updates more efficient and faster.
