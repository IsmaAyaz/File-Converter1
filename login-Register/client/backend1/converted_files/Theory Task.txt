Google Dorking 
Google Dorking refers to using specific search terms or operators on Google to find specific 
information that is not easily accessible through conventional searches. It's often used by 
researchers, security professionals, or hackers to discover sensitive data or vulnerabilities on 
websites by crafting advanced search queries that reveal hidden or private information 
unintentionally exposed on the internet. Common search operators used in Google Dorking 
include  
 filetype: to find specific file types. 
 site: to search within a specific domain.  
 intitle: to find pages with certain keywords in the title. 
SQL & Non-SQL 
SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases: These databases use a structured format with 
tables, rows, and columns to store data. They are like organized spreadsheets with relationships 
between data, using foreign keys to maintain these relationships.  
NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases: These databases store data in various ways, such as 
documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs. They are more flexible and can handle 
large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples include MongoDB, Redis, and 
Cassandra.  
Metaverse: 
Metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, Like the internet, the metaverse will help us 
connect with people when we aren’t physically in the same place and get us even closer to that 
feeling of being together in person. The Metaverse is a virtual world where people can interact 
with each other and digital environments in real-time. It's like an online universe where we can 
socialize, work, play, and explore using avatars and digital items, blending real and digital 
experiences.
